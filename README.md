# GPUbk

**English** | [简体中文](https://github.com/lzzmm/gpubk/blob/main/README.zh-CN.md)

GPUbk is a GPU booking tool for shared Linux servers. The package is named
`gpubk`; the command is the shorter `bk`.

It works offline, stores data in local files, and has no required runtime
dependencies. Users can book GPUs from a plain terminal prompt, a curses TUI,
JSON commands, or an optional local MCP server.

## What It Covers

- Shared and exclusive reservations in configurable intervals (5 minutes by default).
- Automatic queueing, live GPU awareness, and per-GPU VRAM budgets.
- A compact timeline that works on dark and light terminals.
- Scheduled commands with automatic `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
- NVML process monitoring and recent-load history.
- Stable JSON, MCP tools, a bundled Codex Skill, and an optional external allocator.
- Atomic file transactions, UID ownership checks, backups, and an append-only audit log.

GPUbk is a cooperative scheduler. It does not replace Linux device permissions
or stop a user with direct access to `/dev/nvidia*` from bypassing the tool.

## Install

GPUbk requires Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m pip install gpubk          # core CLI and TUI; no dependencies
python3 -m pip install 'gpubk[gpu]'  # add low-overhead NVML telemetry
python3 -m pip install 'gpubk[mcp]'  # add the local MCP server
python3 -m pip install 'gpubk[all]'  # both optional extras
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
bk --version
bk --help
```

Published wheels work with distribution-provided installers. Before installing
from a source checkout or source archive, upgrade pip in that environment:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install .
```

Some older Debian/Ubuntu pip builds ignore the isolated setuptools requested by
`pyproject.toml` and silently create an unusable `UNKNOWN` package. GPUbk detects
that condition and fails with an upgrade hint instead.

## Book GPUs

Shared mode is the default:

```bash
bk 1 30m                         # one GPU for 30 minutes
bk book 1 30m                    # equivalent explicit command form
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g            # 12 GiB expected VRAM per GPU
bk 1 1h --share 1/2             # reserve half of the shared capacity
bk 1 1h --share-with 1          # leave room for at most one minimum-share booking
bk s 1 2h --gpu 3               # explicit shared mode on GPU 3
bk x 2 4h                        # exclusive mode
bk 1 1h --at +30m                # human-friendly relative time
bk 1 1h --at "tomorrow 09:00"   # local wall-clock time
bk 1 1h --start 2030-01-01T20:00:00+08:00  # exact machine time
```

Use `bk COMMAND --help` or `bk help COMMAND` for contextual help. Help never
opens the guided form, full-screen TUI, or MCP stdio server.

Manage your reservations with a list number or short ID:

```bash
bk l
bk e 1 --duration 2h
bk e 1 --at "tomorrow 09:00"
bk d 1
bk lg --limit 100                # recent operations for this UID
bk lg --limit 20 --json          # bounded machine-readable audit events
bk config                         # inspect effective configuration and policy
bk doctor                         # read-only ledger checks
```

Scheduling rules are intentionally small:

- Start times and durations use the server's configured booking boundary.
- Without `--at` or `--start`, GPUbk starts in the active booking interval when possible
  (`12:41` starts at `12:40`) and prints `queued:` when it must start later.
- `--at` accepts `+30m`, `20:00`, `tomorrow 09:00`, or `07-13 20:00`.
  `--start` keeps exact ISO 8601 input for scripts and Agents. Either is exact;
  a conflict returns an error instead of silently moving the reservation.
- An exact new booking may use the current slice boundary or a future boundary. An
  earlier historical slice is rejected; retrying an already-applied operation ID still
  returns the original reservation.
- Each GPU has `max_shared_users` capacity units. A shared booking uses one unit
  by default; `--share 3/4`, `--share 3`, and an exact percentage select a
  larger portion. `--share-with 1` reserves all but one unit. Capacity is checked
  independently in every overlapping booking interval.
- Share units control admission and inferred VRAM, not hardware-enforced SM
  bandwidth. Use MIG/MPS or device controls when physical partitioning is required.
- Exclusive reservations cannot overlap anything.
- `--mem` is expected VRAM **per GPU**. Administrators can require it for all
  shared reservations.
- Times shown to users are local. The ledger stores UTC.

Automatic placement considers reservations, physical free VRAM, current GPU
processes, recent load, and near-future booking pressure. A process without a
reservation is reported and avoided when another suitable GPU is free.

## Inspect and Find Capacity

The plain CLI is designed for the common path:

```bash
bk st                              # compact live status
bk st -v                           # include processes and all reservations
bk st --timeline                   # append the default timeline
bk tl                              # current booking interval, next 2 hours
bk tl 8h --step 15m --gpu 0,1
bk tl --from 20:00 --window 1d --step auto
bk tl --from "2026-07-12T09:00:00+08:00" --window 4h
bk slots 2 1h --mem 12g            # read-only placement alternatives
bk slots x 1 30m --limit 3
```

Timeline cells have fixed width: `··` is free; `M1`-`M9` is total shared
capacity used in a slice that includes one of your bookings; `S1`-`S9` is total
shared capacity used only by others; and `MX`/`XX` are exclusive bookings.
Narrow terminals
wrap the timeline at whole-hour boundaries without reducing the requested
resolution. A past `--from` is read-only and includes retained expired
reservations; cancelled reservations remain hidden.

When the current UID has a pending, claimed, or running scheduled command,
`bk st` also reports the private worker's instance-bound, kernel-proven state
and warns if the command cannot launch. Terminal jobs and ordinary reservations
do not trigger that private-directory probe.

`bk add` and a flag-free `bk edit ID` are recoverable guided flows. They accept
the same natural time forms, re-prompt an invalid field, support `back` and
`cancel`, and show a local-time change summary before writing. An edit cannot
target a reservation that has started or supply a start in the past. `--queue`
may resolve a resource conflict after a valid start, but never repairs an
invalid past time. `bk slots` is read-only and prints a copyable command for its
first option.

## Terminal Interfaces

`bk` opens a normal line-oriented prompt and keeps the terminal background.
`bk t` opens the full-screen TUI.

```bash
bk
bk t
```

Useful TUI keys:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `a` / `e` / `d` | Add, edit, or cancel a reservation |
| `Tab`, `↑`, `↓` | Move between reservations and GPU details |
| `←`, `→` | Browse the timeline; move time in Add/Edit |
| `Space` | Toggle the current GPU in Add/Edit |
| `-`, `=` | Change timeline zoom |
| `[`, `]` | Shorten or extend duration by one configured booking interval |
| `,`, `.` | Quickly shorten or extend duration; step follows zoom |
| `v` | Cycle adjustment speed through 1x, 6x, and 24x |
| `Shift` + adjustment | Use a larger step when the terminal reports it |
| `1`-`9` | Pick a GPU count and jump to the nearest valid slot |
| `s`, `x` | Switch between shared and exclusive in Add/Edit |
| `u` | Set shared capacity as units, a fraction, or a percentage |
| `f`, `g` | Find any suitable GPUs, or keep the selected GPUs fixed |
| `n` | Return to the live `NOW` window |
| `c` | Toggle the dark/light theme |
| `?` | Open the paged help and quick tour |
| `Enter`, `Esc`, `q` | Submit, cancel the current action, or quit |

The TUI refreshes once per second by default. Set `tui_refresh_seconds` in the
configuration, or `BK_TUI_REFRESH_SECONDS` for one environment, when a slower
terminal or lower polling rate is preferred.
The header uses `M:` for the shared telemetry collector and `W:` for this UID's
scheduled-command worker. `W:IDLE` means no current reservation needs automatic
execution; worker state is checked read-only and at most once every ten seconds
while a runnable command exists. Press `r` to invalidate both monitor and worker
status caches immediately.

The timeline can show past reservations, but history is read-only. Add and Edit
always validate the selected interval again inside the locked scheduler
transaction. Reservation focus starts on the header, so no booking blinks until
you press Down. For servers with up to ten GPUs, the `GPU` column keeps one
fixed position per device and shows only the numbers used by that reservation;
empty positions stay blank. Reservation IDs use the shortest unique prefix from
six characters upward, so the table, share details, and process links agree.

## Run a Command at Reservation Time

Put the command after `--`:

```bash
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g -- python train.py --config exp.yaml
bk j                    # list scheduled jobs
bk j --cleanup          # inspect and prune private job files
bk w                    # run this user's due jobs
bk w --status           # read-only worker liveness check
bk jr ID --accept-duplicate-risk  # retry only after checking an uncertain job
```

The worker sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER`,
`BK_RESERVATION_ID`, and `BK_RESERVED_GPUS`. With the default live guard,
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` uses the stable GPU UUIDs from the exact NVML snapshot
that passed launch validation; `BK_RESERVED_GPUS` keeps the user-facing numeric
GPU slots. This avoids assuming that NVML indices equal CUDA ordinals. A real
NVML device without a valid stable identifier remains pending instead of being
launched on a guessed device. Numeric launch tokens remain only for simulation
and the explicitly unsafe `worker_live_guard=false` compatibility path.
Commands, working directories, and the submitting process's `PATH` stay in
UID-owned `0600` job specs; they are signed by the digest and are not written to
the shared ledger. Capturing `PATH` keeps a bare command such as `python` bound
to the same search path when a systemd worker starts outside the interactive
shell. GPUbk deliberately captures no other environment variable. Load project
variables and credentials from a user-owned wrapper or configuration file.
Changing `PATH` while retrying the same operation ID is a different command
intent and is rejected. Existing v1 private specs remain readable.
On a real GPU host, guarded scheduled commands require the `gpu` extra: the
`nvidia-smi` fallback has no trustworthy process list and therefore stays
pending rather than guessing that a device is free.
The worker uses `shell=False` and supervises the command's process group until
it exits or the reservation ends. Commands must not daemonize or create a new
session. Use an explicit shell only when shell syntax is required:

```bash
bk 1 30m -- sh -lc 'python train.py > train.log 2>&1'
```

To keep adjacent reservations from overlapping, the worker sends TERM before
the reservation ends and sends KILL at the exact end if the process group is
still alive. `worker_termination_grace_seconds` controls this warning window
(default 5 seconds, allowed 0.1 through 60). Cancellation and worker shutdown
use the same grace after the event instead. Commands should handle TERM for
checkpointing; the grace is inside the booked interval, not extra GPU time.

Immediately before launch, the worker samples every assigned GPU again. An
exclusive job waits for all non-system processes to leave; a shared job allows
authorized sharers but waits on unreserved/unknown processes or insufficient
physical VRAM. Missing live telemetry also fails closed. The job remains
`pending` with a visible reason and is retried by the continuous worker until
the reservation ends; `bk worker --once` returns `3` when work is waiting.
`worker_live_guard=false` disables this protection and should only be used for
an explicitly accepted compatibility case.

The worker can start multiple due commands concurrently, including legal shared
reservations on the same GPU. Its effective limit is the smaller of
`worker_max_parallel` (default 64) and `gpu_count * max_shared_users`; this keeps
normal shared capacity from being accidentally serialized while retaining an
administrator-controlled process safety cap. `bk worker --max-parallel N`
overrides the cap for that invocation. `bk config` reports both values.

Only one worker can hold a UID's private job directory. The kernel releases its
lease after a crash, so the next worker can recover durable `claimed` or
`running` records without racing a healthy worker. On Linux, recovery reads only
same-UID `/proc` entries, matches the exact `BK_RESERVATION_ID`, rechecks identity
immediately before signalling, then sends TERM and KILL after the configurable
`worker_recovery_grace_seconds` (default 5 seconds). Recovered jobs remain
`uncertain`, even after their process groups stop, because partial side effects
may already exist. Retry requires the explicit duplicate-risk acknowledgement.
Processes recorded on another host are never signalled locally. A concurrent
worker exits with status `75`; the bundled systemd unit does not restart-loop on
that status. During an upgrade, active jobs created by a pre-lease worker are
left untouched and block new claims until they finish or their reservation ends.
If the current worker itself loses ledger access while supervising a command,
its final process-group KILL and reap no longer depends on another successful
ledger read. The unchanged durable job state is intentionally recovered as
`uncertain` after restart rather than being reported as completed or retried.
Worker startup, every polling cycle, and every locked worker transaction validate
the ledger-bound policy. A mismatch exits with status `78` before acquiring a
private lease at startup. Runtime drift stops and reaps supervised commands but
does not reconcile or clean shared state under the wrong policy.

`bk worker --status` reports `running`, `stopped`, `not-seen`, `other-instance`,
`unverified`, or an unsafe/unavailable state without creating or modifying
private storage. `running` requires both the global kernel lock and a
privacy-safe, digest-named instance lock for the configured data directory. The
recorded PID, hostname, acquisition time, and digest text are diagnostic
metadata only. Add `--json` for `gpubk.worker.v1`, or `--require-running` to
return status 2 unless this exact instance's lease is actively held.
`bk jobs --json` and Agent/MCP context expose the same current-UID status.
Creating or editing a reservation with a scheduled command also checks this
lease immediately. Human output warns when no worker is proven running;
JSON/MCP `booking_result.worker` carries the same `gpubk.worker.v1` document
(`null` for reservations without a command). A successful reservation alone
does not prove that its command can launch unattended.

Private command specs are removed after cancellation, success, timeout, or an
expired retry window. The worker checks them at startup, after shutdown, and at
most every five minutes while running. A spec with no ledger reference gets a
24-hour grace period so cleanup cannot race a concurrent booking. Failed,
interrupted, uncertain, pending, claimed, and running jobs keep their specs
while they can still run or be retried. Creation, execution-time reads, and
deletion stay pinned to validated UID-owned private directory descriptors;
symbolic links and hard-linked spec files are rejected. An interrupted write
removes its partial file. If booking completion is ambiguous, GPUbk first
recovers and rereads the ledger, then removes only a spec that has no committed
reference. A stable operation ID also binds the full command digest and working
directory without putting command arguments in the shared ledger. `bk jobs
--cleanup --json` exposes the same cleanup as a machine-readable operation.
Private job logs are deliberately
kept outside shared data. Direct stdout/stderr is drained through a two-segment
rolling log capped at 64 MiB per job by default. Terminal logs are kept for 30
days and oldest terminal logs are pruned if this UID exceeds 4 GiB. Active and
retryable jobs are retained. `bk jobs --cleanup --json` reports spec and log cleanup;
`job_log_retention_days`, `job_log_max_mb`, and `job_log_total_max_mb` configure
the policy, and `0` disables the corresponding limit. Files created by a command
itself, including shell redirections, are outside this policy.

For unattended jobs, each user can install the bundled systemd user unit:

```bash
bk service install worker
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now bk-worker.service
bk doctor --require-worker --strict
```

On systemd Linux, the user manager may stop at logout and may not start at boot.
For genuinely unattended jobs, an administrator can selectively enable linger:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger <worker-user>
```

The generated unit captures the absolute `BK_DATA_DIR`, private
`BK_JOB_LOG_DIR`, an explicit `BK_CONFIG_FILE`, and any explicitly active
non-secret configuration overrides such as `BK_WORKER_MAX_PARALLEL`. Values are
validated and normalized before they enter the unit; allocator commands are
never captured. Review the snapshot with `bk service show worker`; reinstall
with `--force` after changing any captured path or override.
Every worker invocation for one UID must use that same private path so the lease
has one authority. A worker serving another `BK_DATA_DIR` is reported as
`other-instance`, never as ready for the current ledger. Settings without a
captured override are reloaded from the selected configuration path whenever
the service starts. A trusted config file is preferable to shell overrides for
shared deployments.
Persistent worker startup failures are bounded to three attempts per 60 seconds;
ordinary child-command failures are recorded without terminating the long-lived
worker.

## Monitoring and Placement

Install the `gpu` extra, then run a single sample or a low-overhead monitor:

```bash
bk m --once
bk m
bk u                              # this UID, last 24 hours
bk u users --since 30d           # visible per-user summaries
bk u samples --since 2d --resolution 5m --json
bk u events --user me --since 7d
```

NVML is initialized once and device handles are reused. A failed initialization
or stale device handle enters a short backoff and is rebuilt, so a transient
driver fault does not permanently degrade a long-running monitor. The monitor
records bounded scheduling load plus sparse per-user history and process start,
stop, authorization, and workload changes. It does not append a full snapshot
every second. Without NVML, GPUbk falls back to `nvidia-smi` for device metrics.
Because that fallback has no trustworthy process list, GPUbk preserves the last
observed process state and reports the telemetry gap instead of manufacturing
stop/start events. Process-list and per-process-utilization capabilities are
exposed in monitor warnings and Agent GPU details. The collector status tracks
stable CUDA device identifiers and numeric process-UID attribution independently.
The monitor also atomically updates a small `usage/collector.json` heartbeat.
Usage JSON, Agent context, `bk doctor`, and the TUI header expose the same states:
`running`, `degraded`, `stale`, `stopped`, or `topology-mismatch`. A crash becomes
`stale` after three missed heartbeats; a normal exit becomes `stopped`. In the
TUI, `M:OK` means a fresh collector and `M:--` means no heartbeat has been recorded.
Missing stable identifiers or an observed process whose numeric UID cannot be
resolved make the collector `degraded`, so post-start doctor verification cannot
pass while guarded scheduled commands would remain blocked. On hosts using
`hidepid` or containerized `/proc`, grant the selected monitor account only the
administrator-approved process-visibility group needed for attribution; do not
run the collector as root merely to clear the gap.
The default cadence is a 2-second sample folded into 60-second records. Set
`monitor_interval_seconds` and `monitor_rollup_seconds` in the trusted config to
tune this for the server; the rollup must be an exact multiple of the sample
interval. Command-line `--interval` and `--rollup` values override one run.

Process status is based on the process UID and active reservation:
`ok`, `wrong-gpu`, `unreserved`, `unknown`, or `system`. Command lines are
reduced to safe labels before shared logging.

History is stored in checksummed daily partitions with 1-minute, 5-minute,
10-minute, hourly, and daily levels. The public `gpubk.usage.v1` query model is
available through Python, JSON CLI, and MCP; visualizers should not parse storage
files. See [Telemetry](https://github.com/lzzmm/gpubk/blob/main/TELEMETRY.md).
`usage_load_window_minutes` controls how much recent device history is retained
and considered by automatic GPU placement.

The monitor also has a user service:

```bash
bk service install monitor
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now bk-monitor.service
bk doctor --require-monitor --strict
```

For boot and logout persistence, enable linger only for the selected monitor
account if the host requires it:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger <monitor-account>
```

Run exactly one trusted monitor writer on a shared server. Per-user workers are
still separate. The monitor service above is intended for a private server or
for the account whose numeric UID is selected by `monitor_uid`. Its generated
unit captures the absolute shared data directory and explicit trusted config
path, plus any explicit non-secret configuration overrides active at install
time. Uncaptured sampling and rollup values are reloaded from that config whenever
the service starts. A duplicate writer (`75`), role mismatch (`77`), or ledger
policy mismatch (`78`) is not restarted. Other failures retry at most three times
in 60 seconds, allowing a short transient recovery without an endless log loop.
The final command above is a read-only post-start check. Unlike deployment
preflight, it fails when no collector heartbeat has ever been recorded.
A normal signal-driven exit publishes `stopped`. A fatal sampling or storage
error attempts to flush partial rollups but leaves the last `running`/`degraded`
heartbeat untouched so it becomes `stale`; the original nonzero failure remains
visible to systemd and the single-writer lease is still released.
The monitor validates policy before telemetry maintenance or GPU sampling on
every cycle. Policy drift is different from an ordinary sampling failure: pending
rollups are discarded without a crash flush, no graceful stop is published, and
the writer lease is released for operator repair.

## Agents and MCP

Agents should use the versioned JSON interface instead of parsing terminal text:

```bash
bk agent context --compact
bk agent recommend 2 1h30m --mem 12g --compact
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g --share 1/2 --op-id run-20260712-001 --json
bk agent edit 6e957ef1 --duration 2h --op-id edit-20260712-001 --compact
bk agent cancel 6e957ef1 --compact
```

Create and edit operations require a stable operation ID. An identical retry
returns `status=exists`; reusing the ID for a different write is rejected.
GPUbk resolves a committed exact retry before live GPU probing, external
allocation, or private command-spec writes. JSON reports
`allocator.source=idempotent-replay`; when the caller did not already supply
advice, replay-only live fields are `unknown` rather than stale. This confirms
the committed reservation, not that an old working directory or worker remains
launchable. Agent context advertises `capabilities.preflight_idempotent_replay`.
Recommendations are read-only. Identity always comes from the local process UID.

Run the optional stdio MCP server with:

```bash
bk-mcp                       # same as: bk mcp
bk skill install            # installs the bundled Codex Skill
```

The MCP server provides context, recommendation, create, list, edit, cancel,
private-spec cleanup, and private job-log tools. It listens on stdio only; each
user runs their own process. Tool schemas include read-only, idempotent,
destructive, and closed-world annotations.

An administrator may also set `BK_ALLOCATOR_COMMAND` to a trusted local program
that reads `bk.allocator.v1` JSON and returns a GPU ordering. Its output is
advisory: every result still passes the built-in conflict, VRAM, time, UID, and
transaction checks. GPUbk validates the ledger-bound policy before invoking the
allocator for create, recommend, or edit operations. Timeout, invalid output,
and ordinary allocator failures fall back to built-in ordering; an interrupt
terminates the allocator process group before propagating. See the
[Agent protocol](https://github.com/lzzmm/gpubk/blob/main/src/bk/data/codex-skill/gpubk/references/protocol.md).

## Shared Server Setup

Create one setgid directory for the lab group:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 2770 -o root -g gpuusers /data2/shared/bk
sudo install -d -m 0755 -o root -g root /etc/gpubk
```

Put the root-owned configuration at `/etc/gpubk/config.json`, outside the
group-writable ledger directory:

```json
{
  "config_version": 1,
  "data_dir": "/data2/shared/bk",
  "gpu_count": 8,
  "slot_minutes": 5,
  "max_shared_users": 4,
  "queue_search_hours": 168,
  "timeline_hours": 2,
  "lock_timeout_seconds": 10,
  "backup_keep": 10,
  "ledger_retention_days": 90,
  "usage_load_window_minutes": 120,
  "usage_minute_retention_days": 30,
  "usage_five_minute_retention_days": 365,
  "usage_ten_minute_retention_days": 1095,
  "usage_hourly_retention_days": 1500,
  "usage_daily_retention_days": 0,
  "usage_event_retention_days": 365,
  "require_shared_memory": true,
  "shared_memory_reserve_mb": 512,
  "job_log_retention_days": 30,
  "job_log_max_mb": 64,
  "job_log_total_max_mb": 4096,
  "worker_poll_seconds": 1,
  "worker_max_parallel": 64,
  "worker_termination_grace_seconds": 5,
  "worker_claim_timeout_seconds": 30,
  "worker_recovery_grace_seconds": 5,
  "worker_live_guard": true,
  "monitor_interval_seconds": 2,
  "monitor_rollup_seconds": 60,
  "monitor_uid": 1001,
  "storage_gid": 1002,
  "tui_refresh_seconds": 1,
  "file_mode": "0660",
  "dir_mode": "2770"
}
```

```bash
sudo chown root:root /etc/gpubk/config.json
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/gpubk/config.json
```

When neither `BK_DATA_DIR` nor `BK_CONFIG_FILE` is set, GPUbk automatically
discovers `/etc/gpubk/config.json`. A system configuration must contain an
absolute `data_dir`, so normal SSH sessions, MCP clients, and user services all
reach the same ledger without shell startup files. A nonstandard trusted file
can be selected with `BK_CONFIG_FILE`; its `data_dir` field has the same
behavior and is required unless `BK_DATA_DIR` is also set. Explicit
`BK_DATA_DIR` keeps the previous private/data-local behavior and skips automatic
system discovery. Set both variables when deliberately combining an alternate
data directory with an external configuration.

For a private installation without those overrides, GPUbk uses
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/bk` for the ledger, `$XDG_STATE_HOME/bk/jobs` for private job
state, and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user` for installed user units. Per the XDG
base-directory rules, only absolute non-empty XDG values are accepted; relative
or empty values fall back to `$HOME/.local/share`, `$HOME/.local/state`, and
`$HOME/.config`. This keeps CLI and user services on the same paths regardless
of their working directory. An explicit `BK_JOB_LOG_DIR` or `job_log_dir` must
be absolute (a leading `~` is expanded).

Replace `1001` with `id -u <monitor-account>` and `1002` with
`getent group gpuusers | cut -d: -f3`. `storage_gid` is optional, but setting it
binds the data root itself to the lab group's numeric GID; a consistently
mis-grouped directory tree is then rejected instead of looking healthy merely
because all children match one another. It requires a setgid `dir_mode`.
The configuration file and every
directory that contains it must be owned by root or the current UID and must
not be writable by group or other users. A
root-owned file inside `/data2/shared/bk` is still replaceable by members who
can write that directory, regardless of the file's `0644` mode. GPUbk therefore
opens the configured parent chain and file by descriptor and rejects that layout.
For a single-user installation, the backward-compatible default remains
`$BK_DATA_DIR/config.json` whenever `BK_DATA_DIR` is explicitly selected.

A monitor writing to a group-writable data directory has stricter checks: it
requires a trusted root-owned external or system configuration, a configured
`monitor_uid`, and an exact match with the process UID. Exit status `77` means
the process is not the configured writer. Single-user private directories do
not require this role setting. Applied usage maintenance and migration use the
same role; their dry-run forms stay available to ordinary users.
Exit status `78` from either daemon means its effective policy differs from the
ledger. Do not retry with altered limits; inspect `bk config`, repair the trusted
configuration, reinstall captured service settings if necessary, then restart.

`max_shared_users` is retained as the compatible configuration name; it now
defines whole shared capacity units per GPU. Old reservations without a
`share_units` field consume one unit.

`slot_minutes` controls booking start and duration granularity. It defaults to
`5` and may be any divisor of one hour from 1 through 60. `BK_SLOT_MINUTES`
overrides it for single-user or test setups. On a shared server, keep this in the
trusted root-owned file: the ledger binds the value on first write and rejects
clients using another grid.

Inspect the resolved settings without creating or changing data:

```bash
bk config
bk config --json
```

Environment variables override ordinary file values, and a command flag
overrides the corresponding default for that invocation. Security role
`monitor_uid` and `storage_gid` are file-only and cannot be replaced by
environment variables.
New files should declare
`"config_version": 1`; unversioned files remain readable for compatibility.
Unknown keys, wrong types, non-finite numbers, unsafe paths, and excessive
values are rejected instead of ignored. The JSON report lists active override
names but never prints the external allocator command.

Scheduling policy, retention, worker timing and concurrency, allocator integration, and display
defaults are configurable. Schema versions, transaction durability, path and
permission checks, record-size limits, and other corruption defenses are fixed
implementation safeguards rather than administrator tuning knobs.

Ledger reads validate every reservation field used for admission: identity,
GPU IDs, mode, status, and ordered timestamps. Unknown extension fields remain
preserved for forward compatibility, while an unknown value in a current
semantic field fails closed. A semantically damaged primary ledger can fall
back only to a backup that passes the same complete validation.

All users and user services must resolve the same data and configuration paths.
The standard `/etc/gpubk/config.json` layout provides that automatically. The
first write binds scheduling and storage policy into the ledger. Enabling
`storage_gid` also binds that GID on the next write; once bound, every client
must use the same trusted value. Clients with conflicting settings fail closed.
Run the deployment preflight from a clean login environment before enabling services:

```bash
bk config
bk doctor --probe --strict
bk doctor --probe --json --strict
```

Run these commands as the account selected by `monitor_uid`. On Linux, preflight
checks that this account can read numeric ownership for a process belonging to
another UID. A restrictive `hidepid` or container procfs policy fails the probe;
if no other UID currently has a visible process, the result is `warn` because
cross-user attribution has not yet been demonstrated. Rerun the probe while an
ordinary process from another lab user exists; no GPU workload is required.

After enabling the monitor, verify the long-running writer separately:

```bash
bk doctor --require-monitor --strict
bk doctor --require-monitor --json --strict
```

Each user who enables scheduled commands should verify that their private worker
holds the lease for this exact data directory:

```bash
bk doctor --require-worker --strict
bk doctor --require-worker --json --strict
```

Both flags can be combined when checking a complete current-user deployment.
Ordinary `doctor` reports the privacy-safe worker state without requiring the
optional service or creating its private directory.

`bk reset` is intentionally disabled for a shared data-directory mode. To retire
or rebuild a shared ledger, stop all GPUbk writers, back it up, and use an
administrator-controlled filesystem procedure. The command remains available
for private and disposable simulation directories.

The probe creates randomly named temporary files, verifies same-directory atomic
replace and directory fsync, checks same-host cross-process `flock`, confirms
configured modes, setgid GID inheritance, and free space, probes the real GPU
telemetry source, and then removes its files. GPU indices must exactly match
`0..gpu_count-1`; every NVML
device must report usable memory, a process list, a stable CUDA-compatible GPU
identifier, and per-process utilization.
A topology mismatch or missing process list fails the probe. Missing per-process
utilization, simulation, or an `nvidia-smi` fallback is a strict-mode warning.
In JSON, `healthy` covers read-only ledger checks; `ready` remains `null` until
`--probe` supplies deployment evidence.
Plain `doctor` never initializes storage, acquires a lock, recovers a pending
transaction, or follows a symbolic link or hard-linked alias at a managed path.
It also reports permission and GID drift across the ledger, backups, and telemetry
tree. Configured mode or setgid-group drift makes write commands fail closed before
mutating data instead of silently running `chmod` or `chgrp`; only explicit
`--probe` writes temporary files. In setgid mode, the numeric GID of the data
directory is the inheritance anchor for every managed directory and file.
For NFS/FUSE used by multiple hosts, additionally verify locking from a second
host because one machine cannot prove cross-host lock propagation. Every writer
must use GPUbk.

recovery, private job specs, MCP isolation, and administrator responsibilities.

## Try It Without a GPU

Booking and the TUI can run with simulated GPU count:

```bash
BK_DATA_DIR=/tmp/gpubk-demo BK_GPU_COUNT=4 BK_MAX_SHARED_USERS=4 bk t
BK_DATA_DIR=/tmp/gpubk-demo BK_GPU_COUNT=4 BK_MAX_SHARED_USERS=4 bk 1 30m --share 3/4
```

The cards show unknown hardware metrics, but scheduling, shared capacity, the
timeline, Add/Edit, logs, and Agent JSON remain usable.

## Development

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[mcp,gpu]'
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
PYTHONPATH=src python3 benchmarks/scheduler_queue.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 benchmarks/usage_store.py
```
