# GPUbk

**English** | [简体中文](https://github.com/lzzmm/gpubk/blob/main/README.zh-CN.md)

GPUbk is a GPU booking tool for shared Linux servers. The package is named
`gpubk`; the command is the shorter `bk`.

It works offline, stores data in local files, and has no required runtime
dependencies. Users can book GPUs from a plain terminal prompt, a curses TUI,
JSON commands, or an optional local MCP server.

## What It Covers

- Shared and exclusive reservations in 5-minute intervals.
- Automatic queueing, live GPU awareness, and per-GPU VRAM budgets.
- A compact timeline that works on dark and light terminals.
- Scheduled commands with automatic `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
- NVML process monitoring and recent-load history.
- Stable JSON, MCP tools, a bundled Codex Skill, and an optional external allocator.
- Atomic file transactions, UID ownership checks, backups, and an append-only audit log.

GPUbk is a cooperative scheduler. It does not replace Linux device permissions
or stop a user with direct access to `/dev/nvidia*` from bypassing the tool.

## Install

GPUbk requires Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m pip install gpubk          # core CLI and TUI; no dependencies
python3 -m pip install 'gpubk[gpu]'  # add low-overhead NVML telemetry
python3 -m pip install 'gpubk[mcp]'  # add the local MCP server
python3 -m pip install 'gpubk[all]'  # both optional extras
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
bk --version
bk --help
```

## Book GPUs

Shared mode is the default:

```bash
bk 1 30m                         # one GPU for 30 minutes
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g            # 12 GiB expected VRAM per GPU
bk s 1 2h --gpu 3               # explicit shared mode on GPU 3
bk x 2 4h                        # exclusive mode
bk 1 1h --at +30m                # human-friendly relative time
bk 1 1h --at "tomorrow 09:00"   # local wall-clock time
bk 1 1h --start 2030-01-01T20:00:00+08:00  # exact machine time
```

Manage your reservations with a list number or short ID:

```bash
bk l
bk e 1 --duration 2h
bk e 1 --at "tomorrow 09:00"
bk d 1
bk doctor                         # read-only ledger checks
```

Scheduling rules are intentionally small:

- Start times and durations use 5-minute boundaries.
- Without `--at` or `--start`, GPUbk starts in the active 5-minute interval when possible
  (`12:41` starts at `12:40`) and prints `queued:` when it must start later.
- `--at` accepts `+30m`, `20:00`, `tomorrow 09:00`, or `07-13 20:00`.
  `--start` keeps exact ISO 8601 input for scripts and Agents. Either is exact;
  a conflict returns an error instead of silently moving the reservation.
- Shared capacity is counted per overlapping reservation. Exclusive
  reservations cannot overlap anything.
- `--mem` is expected VRAM **per GPU**. Administrators can require it for all
  shared reservations.
- Times shown to users are local. The ledger stores UTC.

Automatic placement considers reservations, physical free VRAM, current GPU
processes, recent load, and near-future booking pressure. A process without a
reservation is reported and avoided when another suitable GPU is free.

## Inspect and Find Capacity

The plain CLI is designed for the common path:

```bash
bk st                              # compact live status
bk st -v                           # include processes and all reservations
bk st --timeline                   # append the default timeline
bk tl                              # current 5-minute interval, next 2 hours
bk tl 8h --step 15m --gpu 0,1
bk tl --from 20:00 --window 1d --step auto
bk slots 2 1h --mem 12g            # read-only placement alternatives
bk slots x 1 30m --limit 3
```

Timeline cells have fixed width: `··` is free, `MM` is yours, `XX` is
exclusive, and `S1`-`S9` is the shared reservation count. Narrow terminals
wrap the timeline at whole-hour boundaries without reducing the requested
resolution.

`bk add` and a flag-free `bk edit ID` are recoverable guided flows. They accept
the same natural time forms, re-prompt an invalid field, support `back` and
`cancel`, and show a local-time change summary before writing. `bk slots` is
read-only and prints a copyable command for its first option.

## Terminal Interfaces

`bk` opens a normal line-oriented prompt and keeps the terminal background.
`bk t` opens the full-screen TUI.

```bash
bk
bk t
```

Useful TUI keys:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `a` / `e` / `d` | Add, edit, or cancel a reservation |
| `Tab`, `↑`, `↓` | Move between reservations and GPU details |
| `←`, `→` | Browse the timeline; move time in Add/Edit |
| `Space` | Toggle the current GPU in Add/Edit |
| `-`, `=` | Change timeline zoom |
| `[`, `]` | Shorten or extend duration; normally 5 minutes |
| `,`, `.` | Quickly shorten or extend duration; step follows zoom |
| `v` | Cycle adjustment speed through 1x, 6x, and 24x |
| `Shift` + adjustment | Use a larger step when the terminal reports it |
| `1`-`9` | Pick a GPU count and jump to the nearest valid slot |
| `s`, `x` | Switch between shared and exclusive in Add/Edit |
| `f`, `g` | Find any suitable GPUs, or keep the selected GPUs fixed |
| `n` | Return to the live `NOW` window |
| `c` | Toggle the dark/light theme |
| `?` | Open the paged help and quick tour |
| `Enter`, `Esc`, `q` | Submit, cancel the current action, or quit |

The timeline can show past reservations, but history is read-only. Add and Edit
always validate the selected interval again inside the locked scheduler
transaction. Reservation focus starts on the header, so no booking blinks until
you press Down. For servers with up to ten GPUs, the `GPU` column keeps one
fixed position per device and shows only the numbers used by that reservation;
empty positions stay blank.

## Run a Command at Reservation Time

Put the command after `--`:

```bash
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g -- python train.py --config exp.yaml
bk j                    # list scheduled jobs
bk w                    # run this user's due jobs
```

The worker sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER`,
`BK_RESERVATION_ID`, and `BK_RESERVED_GPUS`. Commands and working directories
stay in UID-owned `0600` job specs; they are not written to the shared ledger.
The worker uses `shell=False`. Use an explicit shell only when shell syntax is
required:

```bash
bk 1 30m -- sh -lc 'python train.py > train.log 2>&1'
```

For unattended jobs, each user can install the bundled systemd user unit:

```bash
bk service install worker
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now bk-worker.service
```

## Monitoring and Placement

Install the `gpu` extra, then run a single sample or a low-overhead monitor:

```bash
bk m --once
bk m
bk u                              # this UID, last 24 hours
bk u users --since 30d           # visible per-user summaries
bk u samples --since 2d --resolution 5m --json
bk u events --user me --since 7d
```

NVML is initialized once and device handles are reused. The monitor records
bounded scheduling load plus sparse per-user history and process start, stop,
authorization, and workload changes. It does not append a full snapshot every
second. Without NVML, GPUbk falls back to `nvidia-smi` with less process detail.

Process status is based on the process UID and active reservation:
`ok`, `wrong-gpu`, `unreserved`, `unknown`, or `system`. Command lines are
reduced to safe labels before shared logging.

History is stored in checksummed daily partitions with 1-minute, 5-minute,
10-minute, hourly, and daily levels. The public `gpubk.usage.v1` query model is
available through Python, JSON CLI, and MCP; visualizers should not parse storage
files. See [Telemetry](https://github.com/lzzmm/gpubk/blob/main/TELEMETRY.md).

The monitor also has a user service:

```bash
bk service install monitor
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now bk-monitor.service
```

Run exactly one trusted monitor writer on a shared server. Per-user workers are
still separate. The monitor service above is intended for a private server or
for the one account selected by the administrator.

## Agents and MCP

Agents should use the versioned JSON interface instead of parsing terminal text:

```bash
bk agent context --compact
bk agent recommend 2 1h30m --mem 12g --compact
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g --op-id run-20260712-001 --json
bk agent edit 6e957ef1 --duration 2h --op-id edit-20260712-001 --compact
bk agent cancel 6e957ef1 --compact
```

Create and edit operations require a stable operation ID. An identical retry
returns `status=exists`; reusing the ID for a different write is rejected.
Recommendations are read-only. Identity always comes from the local process UID.

Run the optional stdio MCP server with:

```bash
bk-mcp                       # same as: bk mcp
bk skill install            # installs the bundled Codex Skill
```

The MCP server provides context, recommendation, create, list, edit, cancel,
and private job-log tools. It listens on stdio only; each user runs their own
process. Tool schemas include read-only, idempotent, destructive, and
closed-world annotations.

An administrator may also set `BK_ALLOCATOR_COMMAND` to a trusted local program
that reads `bk.allocator.v1` JSON and returns a GPU ordering. Its output is
advisory: every result still passes the built-in conflict, VRAM, time, UID, and
transaction checks. See the [Agent protocol](https://github.com/lzzmm/gpubk/blob/main/src/bk/data/codex-skill/gpubk/references/protocol.md).

## Shared Server Setup

Create one setgid directory for the lab group:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 2770 -o root -g gpuusers /data2/shared/bk
export BK_DATA_DIR=/data2/shared/bk
```

Put a root-owned `config.json` in that directory:

```json
{
  "gpu_count": 8,
  "max_shared_users": 2,
  "queue_search_hours": 168,
  "ledger_retention_days": 90,
  "usage_load_window_minutes": 120,
  "usage_minute_retention_days": 30,
  "usage_five_minute_retention_days": 365,
  "usage_ten_minute_retention_days": 1095,
  "usage_hourly_retention_days": 1500,
  "usage_daily_retention_days": 0,
  "usage_event_retention_days": 365,
  "require_shared_memory": true,
  "shared_memory_reserve_mb": 512,
  "file_mode": "0660",
  "dir_mode": "2770"
}
```

```bash
sudo chown root:gpuusers /data2/shared/bk/config.json
sudo chmod 0644 /data2/shared/bk/config.json
```

All users and user services must use the same `BK_DATA_DIR`. The first write
binds scheduling and storage policy into the ledger; clients with conflicting
settings fail closed. Verify `flock` and atomic rename on the actual NFS or FUSE
mount before deployment. Every writer must use GPUbk.

See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/lzzmm/gpubk/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for the supported boundary, file safety, WAL
recovery, private job specs, MCP isolation, and administrator responsibilities.

## Try It Without a GPU

Booking and the TUI can run with simulated GPU count:

```bash
BK_DATA_DIR=/tmp/gpubk-demo BK_GPU_COUNT=4 bk t
BK_DATA_DIR=/tmp/gpubk-demo BK_GPU_COUNT=4 bk 1 30m
```

The cards show unknown hardware metrics, but scheduling, shared capacity, the
timeline, Add/Edit, logs, and Agent JSON remain usable.
