# GPUBK Agent Protocol

## JSON CLI

Booking and allocation responses use `schema_version: "bk.agent.v1"`. The personal
audit-tail response uses `schema_version: "gpubk.audit.v1"`; worker liveness uses
`schema_version: "gpubk.worker.v1"`.

Omitting `--start` uses the active configured booking interval when possible, then permits earliest-slot queueing. Providing `--start` means exact placement at the active slice boundary or a future boundary; a new write to an older historical slice is rejected. Read `policy.granularity_minutes` from context instead of assuming five minutes. Human CLI users may use `--at`; Agents should keep using explicit ISO 8601 and structured fields.
The ledger binds scheduling and storage policy on first write. Agents must surface policy-mismatch errors instead of retrying with altered local limits. Read `policy.storage_transport`: `broker` means shared mutations are authenticated by kernel peer UID and committed by the service account; `direct` is the private/legacy file path. `policy.access_mode` describes who may connect (`private`, `group`, or `all`), not who may write ledger files. `broker_socket` and `broker_uid` are trusted deployment facts. `storage_gid` applies only to compatible direct setgid deployments.

Recommendation fields:

- Context `administrator` and `bk info` use `gpubk.administrator.v1`. They expose the selected
  Linux administrator account and sanitized GECOS contact fields so an Agent can direct an
  operational issue to a human; they are not authentication or authorization data.
- Context policy exposes `enabled_gpus`, `disabled_gpus`, and integer `gpu_priority` tiers.
  Disabled GPUs remain visible for monitoring and history but are never legal placements. Larger
  priority values are less preferred only among otherwise-equivalent choices; the earliest legal
  start remains authoritative. Request `exclude_gpus` further removes devices from one automatic
  recommendation or write and is mutually exclusive with a fixed GPU list.
- `available`: whether the requested semantics have a legal slot.
- `recommendation.gpus`, `start_at`, `end_at`, `queued`, `confidence`.
- Context GPU entries include model name, temperature, live status, physical VRAM, recent load
  history, and additive `capabilities.stable_device_identifier`,
  `capabilities.process_telemetry`, and `capabilities.process_utilization` booleans. Stable device
  identifiers let the worker bind the exact NVML-checked GPUs to CUDA without trusting ordinal
  equality. Treat any missing capability as degraded evidence, never as proof that launch is safe.
- Context VRAM fields preserve zero: `memory.used_mb=0` is a known empty reading, while `null`
  means physical memory telemetry is unavailable. Consumers must not merge these states.
- Context `policy.monitoring` reports the effective sample and rollup cadence; consumers must
  not infer finer telemetry precision. `writer_uid` identifies the configured telemetry role,
  not the Agent caller.
- Context `policy.monitoring.collector` and every `gpubk.usage.v1` response report collector
  freshness. Treat live values as current only when `fresh=true`. `degraded` identifies explicit
  stable-device-identifier, process-identity, or device/process capability gaps; inspect
  `stable_device_identifier_gap` and `process_identity_gap` before promising unattended launch.
  `stale`, `stopped`, `not-seen`, `clock-skew`, `invalid`, and `incompatible` are never evidence that a GPU has no
  processes. `topology-mismatch` means the fresh monitor covers a different GPU count than the
  active policy and is also not current.
- `gpu_details`: live status, predicted recent load, reservation pressure, physical free VRAM, and projected reservation headroom.
- `nearest_available`: suggestion only when an exact request is unavailable.
- `share_units_per_gpu` and `share_capacity_units_per_gpu`: integer admission slots requested and available on each GPU. Missing request fields on legacy reservations mean one slot.
- `warnings`: incomplete history, live-busy device, memory assumption, or allocator fallback.
- Scheduled job objects may include `launch_guard_state=waiting`, `waiting_since`, and a
  privacy-safe `message`; exit status `3` from `bk worker --once` means due work is waiting for
  a safe live GPU state, not that the command ran.
- Scheduled job objects may include `recovery_state` and `recovered_at`. `terminated` means a
  same-UID process group was stopped after worker loss, but job status remains `uncertain` because
  earlier side effects cannot be disproved. `remote-unverified`, `unverified`, and
  `termination-unverified` must never trigger automatic retry.
- Context capabilities advertise `single_worker_lease`, `scheduled_job_crash_recovery`,
  `scheduled_job_path_snapshot`, `worker_liveness`, `worker_instance_binding`,
  `daemon_policy_guard`, and `collector_liveness`. A path snapshot means only the submitting
  process's `PATH` is signed into the private job spec; no other Agent environment is inherited.
  Worker exit `75` means the UID-private lease is already held; do not retry in a tight loop.
  Context `policy.daemon_policy_exit_code` is `78`; worker or monitor exit `78` is a persistent
  ledger-policy mismatch that requires operator repair and must not be automatically retried.
- Context `worker` and `bk jobs --json` embed `gpubk.worker.v1`. Only `state=running` with
  `running=true`, `lease_held=true`, and `instance_match=true` is a positive liveness result,
  based on the UID-private global lock and matching digest-named instance lock. `lease` metadata
  is diagnostic and may be absent or stale. `other-instance` means the lock owner serves another
  ledger; `unverified` means its instance cannot be proven. `bk worker --status --require-running`
  returns exit 2 for every non-running state without starting a worker or writing storage.
- Context policy exposes `worker_max_parallel` and `worker_effective_max_parallel`. The latter is
  the topology-bounded default concurrency for scheduled commands, including legal same-GPU
  shared jobs; it is not additional booking capacity.
- `policy.worker_termination_grace_seconds` is charged inside a reservation: TERM is sent that
  far before `end_at`, and KILL is sent at `end_at` if needed. Agents should budget useful runtime
  accordingly and make scheduled commands handle TERM for checkpointing.
- Human `bk status` and the TUI `worker=` header inspect that lease only while the current UID has a job that may
  still run automatically; terminal jobs do not create a stale worker warning.

Create and edit return the same `kind=booking_result` shape through JSON CLI and MCP: `status`, a
privacy-safe `reservation`, per-GPU `allocation.selected` explanations, allocator source/reason,
`worker`, and warnings. `worker` is the current `gpubk.worker.v1` result for a scheduled command
and `null` when the reservation has no command. Only `worker.running=true` together with
`lease_held=true` and `instance_match=true` proves that unattended launch is currently available.
Status is `created`, `updated`, `queued`, or retry-safe `exists`.
For an exact committed create/edit replay, `allocator.source=idempotent-replay`: GPUBK did not rerun
GPU telemetry, history loading, the external allocator, or private-spec creation. Unless advice was
already supplied by the in-process caller, `allocation.selected.live_status=unknown` and load
history is empty. This is committed-write evidence, not current launch-readiness evidence.

Cancellation returns `kind=cancellation_result`, the cancelled reservation, and
`private_job_cleanup`. A non-null cleanup warning means cancellation committed but the owning UID
could not remove one or more private command specs; do not repeat the destructive cancellation.
`bk j --cleanup --json` is the retry-safe cleanup operation. It retains runnable/retryable specs,
applies a 24-hour grace period to unreferenced specs, and applies the configured age/quota policy
only to terminal private job logs.
`private_job_cleanup` reports `removed`, `retained`, `deferred_orphans`, `failed`, and `warnings`.
`private_job_log_cleanup` additionally reports retained/removed bytes and unresolved quota excess.

`bk log --json` returns `kind=operation-log`, the process `uid`, the requested `limit`, recent
matching `events` in chronological order, and a nullable `warning`. It reads backward with bounded
memory, scans at most 64 MiB, skips malformed records, and never accepts a UID argument.

`share` accepts only an integer from 1 through `shared_capacity_units_per_gpu`. It controls scheduling admission and inferred VRAM, not hardware-enforced compute bandwidth. Explicit `expected_memory` remains the actual per-GPU estimate and is not multiplied by share slots.

## MCP Tools

- `get_gpu_context`: privacy-safe policy, telemetry, forecast, and reservations.
- `recommend_gpu_booking`: read-only recommendation.
- `create_gpu_booking`: idempotent write; `operation_id` is required.
- `list_gpu_reservations`: active global or current-UID reservations.
- `edit_my_gpu_booking`: idempotent current-UID edit; `operation_id` is required.
- `cancel_my_gpu_booking`: current UID only.
- `cleanup_my_job_specs`: idempotently prune only this UID's non-runnable private command specs.
- `cleanup_my_job_logs`: idempotently apply this UID's terminal log retention and quota policy.
- `read_my_job_log`: bounded current-UID private log tail.
- `get_my_gpu_usage`: versioned current-UID summaries, samples, and optional audit events.

The MCP server runs over local stdio and inherits the launching user's UID. It never accepts UID as a tool argument.
Historical usage also has a read-only `bk://usage/me/recent` resource. External visualizers should consume
`gpubk.usage.v1` through `bk.usage_api.UsageQueryService` rather than parse compact storage partitions.
Tools expose standard MCP annotations: context, recommendation, listing, and log reads are
read-only; create and edit are idempotent writes because they require operation IDs; cancel is
destructive and non-idempotent; private-spec cleanup is destructive but idempotent; all tools are
closed-world local operations.

## Cluster Federation

Cluster responses use `schema_version: "gpubk.cluster.v1"`. The root-owned catalog
binds a display name and priority to an expected stable node ID. Every remote Agent,
usage, recommendation, and booking response includes `node.id`; a mismatch fails
closed. `cluster-context` returns each node's ordinary `bk.agent.v1` context without
flattening node-local GPU indexes. `cluster-recommendation` ranks by start, node
priority, and node name after validating duration, exact start, and any echoed request
fields. Each node entry includes `rejected_reason` and `write_compatible`.
`cluster-booking-result` contains one destination node, one
stable operation ID, and the unchanged destination `bk.agent.v1` result. Automation must
inspect `result.warnings`; human cluster output prints the same distinct warnings with the
destination node name, while structured output does not duplicate them on stderr.
Cluster edit and cancel accept caller-supplied stable operation IDs and return a
`cluster-mutation-result` containing the owning node and unchanged destination result.
`cluster-check` reports per-node reachability, stable identity, actor attribution,
clock skew, schedulable GPU count, required write capabilities, and the current remote
actor's worker state. With `--jobs`, scheduled-job capabilities and a running worker are
required on every enabled node. Without it, a pending scheduled command and stopped worker
is a warning rather than a reservation-readiness failure. Its `ready` field is false when
no enabled node is usable. `cluster-node-probe` is a pre-catalog, read-only SSH discovery
document with the validated node ID, endpoint metadata, issues, and a tokenized `add_argv`;
`add_argv` is null unless clocks, actor identity, GPUs, and retry-safe booking capabilities
all pass. Catalog nodes
omit `enabled` for the default
true state and use `enabled=false` for maintenance; disabled nodes remain visible in
context/history but are not contacted or considered for placement.

Reservation references outside their owning node use `NODE/SHORT_ID`. Automatic
booking never splits a request across nodes. Edit and cancel route back to the node
prefix. Cross-node usage combines UIDs only when the administrator catalog maps their
`(node_id, uid)` pairs to the same principal; identical usernames remain separate.
SSH is the authentication boundary and the remote process's numeric UID is authoritative.
An explicit operation-ID retry is fail-closed when a disabled or unreachable node prevents
the client from proving where that operation was committed. Never reroute that retry.
For a cluster scheduled command, the client injects its operation ID and structured-output
flag only before the `--` delimiter and forwards every workload argument after the delimiter
unchanged. Routing additionally requires `scheduled_jobs`, `scheduled_job_path_snapshot`,
and `private_job_specs`; ordinary reservation writes continue to use the smaller booking
capability set so rolling read-only compatibility is preserved.

An operation ID identifies one immutable write intent for the current UID, including a scheduled
command's submission `PATH`. Exact retries return
`status=exists`, including confirmation after the original start; reusing that ID with another
reservation, different fields, different command arguments, or a different working directory
returns a structured error. The shared ledger stores only the command digest and public summary.
After an ambiguous interruption, GPUBK recovers and rereads the ledger before deleting only an
unreferenced private spec, so integrations should retry the exact intent with the same operation
ID. The preflight replay can still confirm a committed command after its old working directory was
removed; inspect `worker` and job state separately because execution may no longer be possible. New
exact starts before the active booking slice, started reservation edits, and explicit edit starts
in the past are rejected. A valid edit start remains exact unless `allow_queue=true` is explicitly
supplied to resolve a resource conflict.
Each retained reservation keeps at most 256 idempotent edit intents so malformed automation cannot grow one hot record without bound. Recreate an unusually long-lived reservation before exceeding that limit.

## External Allocator

Input uses `schema_version: "bk.allocator.v1"` and includes a privacy-safe request, policy
(including `granularity_minutes`, enabled/disabled GPUs, and priority tiers), built-in scores,
per-GPU telemetry/history, request exclusions, and active reservation windows.

Return exactly one JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "bk.allocator.v1",
  "gpu_order": [0, 1, 2, 3],
  "reason": "short privacy-safe rationale"
}
```

`gpu_order` must be a complete permutation of every configured index, including entries that are
currently ineligible. GPUBK filters administrator-disabled and request-excluded GPUs locally. The
remaining order is blended into local scores and cannot bypass deterministic placement
validation. GPUBK rejects ledger-policy mismatch before invoking the
allocator. Timeout, malformed output, nonzero exit, and ordinary execution errors use built-in
fallback ordering; process interrupts terminate the allocator process group before propagating.
