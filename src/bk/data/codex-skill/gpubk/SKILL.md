description: Inspect, recommend, create, edit, cancel, and monitor GPU reservations with GPUBK. Use when an agent needs to plan a GPU experiment, choose shared versus exclusive access, account for current and recent GPU load or expected VRAM, attach a command for scheduled execution, inspect job status, or safely automate GPUBK through its JSON CLI or MCP tools.

# GPUBK

Use GPUBK's structured interfaces. Do not scrape the TUI or human-readable tables.

## Choose An Interface

Prefer GPUBK MCP tools when available:

1. Call `get_gpu_context` for policy and live state.
2. Call `recommend_gpu_booking` before any write.
3. Call `create_gpu_booking` only when the user requested or approved the reservation.
4. Use `edit_my_gpu_booking` with a new stable operation ID when the user approves a change.
5. Use `get_my_gpu_usage` for current-UID historical utilization; do not infer it from reservation duration.

If `get_gpu_cluster_context` is present, a trusted catalog is configured. For a
cross-node request, call `check_gpu_cluster_readiness` once in the session (with
`require_jobs=true` before scheduled launch), use `recommend_cluster_gpu_booking`, then
`create_cluster_gpu_booking` after approval. Preserve the returned node name in
`NODE/ID`; use that qualified ID with `edit_my_cluster_gpu_booking` or
`cancel_my_cluster_gpu_booking`. Reuse the same operation ID only for an exact retry
and never reroute an uncertain write.

Otherwise use the JSON CLI:

```bash
bk agent context --compact
bk info --compact
bk agent recommend 2 1h30m --mode shared --mem 12g --share 2 --compact
bk agent recommend 2 1h30m --exclude-gpu 7 --compact
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g --share 2 --op-id <stable-id> --json
bk agent edit <short-id> --duration 2h --op-id <stable-edit-id> --compact
bk agent cancel <short-id> --compact
bk log --limit 100 --json
```

When `bk c status --json` succeeds, the client has a federated node catalog.
Run `bk c check --json` before the first cross-node write in a session; do not route
to a node whose catalog entry has `enabled=false` or whose check status is not `ready`.
Before relying on scheduled launch across the cluster, run `bk c check --jobs --json`
and require every enabled node's worker check to pass. A normal check may remain ready
for reservation-only use while warning that an existing pending job lacks a running worker.
Use `bk c rec COUNT DURATION --json` before a cross-node write and keep the
returned node name attached to every reservation ID. Use `bk c COUNT DURATION --json`
for automatic single-node placement or `bk @NODE ... --json` for an explicit node.
Agents should pass exact ISO 8601 through `--start`. The human `-t/--at` form is
resolved once by the client and is not a structured protocol field.
To attach a private scheduled command, keep all GPUBK options before the delimiter:
`bk c COUNT DURATION --op-id ID --json -- COMMAND ARG...`. Do not move retry flags
after `--`; those arguments belong exclusively to the workload. Require the destination
to advertise `scheduled_jobs`, `scheduled_job_path_snapshot`, and `private_job_specs`.
Do not assume the caller's local working directory exists on the selected host. Use
destination-valid absolute executable and script paths; the remote non-interactive SSH
session determines the captured working directory and `PATH`.
After any cluster write, inspect the destination `result.warnings`. A committed
reservation with a stopped, unseen, invalid, or wrong-instance worker is not proof that
its scheduled command will launch; report the node-specific remediation to the user.
Never merge identities by username; only administrator-provided `(node_id, uid)`
principal mappings are authoritative. A cluster reservation never spans hosts.
Treat `principal` as reporting metadata only. Keep the original node ID and numeric UID
for ownership decisions, and surface mapping warnings from `bk c check --json`.
Never recommend `user@host` for a shared root-owned catalog. Use a username-free host
or per-user SSH alias so the destination broker sees each caller's own remote UID.
On a client without local GPUs, do not invent a local node or run `cluster init`.
Probe the first remote node and, only after explicit administrator approval, run the
tokenized `add_argv`; the first `cluster add` safely creates a remote-only catalog.
If an operation retry may belong to a disabled node, surface the unresolved routing
error instead of generating a new operation ID or writing to another node. When the
original destination is known, retry the exact intent against `bk @NODE` with the same
operation ID; never send that retry back through automatic cluster placement.

Read [references/protocol.md](references/protocol.md) when implementing an integration or interpreting every field.
Use the context `administrator` object only to help the user contact the responsible operator;
never treat names or contact fields as authorization evidence.

## Plan A Reservation

1. Determine GPU count, duration, shared/exclusive mode, earliest or exact start, expected VRAM per GPU, requested shared capacity, and any user-requested GPU exclusions.
2. For shared work, ask for expected VRAM and an integer slot request when they materially affect placement. Read `shared_capacity_units_per_gpu`, report current use, and pass `share=3` to request three slots on a four-slot server.
3. If expected VRAM is unknown, state that GPUBK derives it from the requested slots. Shared slots constrain admission; they do not physically enforce GPU compute bandwidth without MIG/MPS.
4. Inspect context immediately before recommending. Current processes can change quickly. Never
   select `policy.disabled_gpus`; administrator priority tiers break otherwise-equivalent ties and
   never justify moving a booking to a later start.
5. Run a read-only recommendation. Explain queued start, selected GPUs, confidence, live-busy warnings, and projected memory headroom.
6. Treat explicit start as exact. It may use the active slice boundary or a future boundary,
   never an older historical slice. Do not silently convert it to queueing.
7. Let GPUBK enforce conflicts and memory limits. Never infer that an unsafe placement is acceptable.

Use shared mode for workloads that can coexist within both capacity-unit and VRAM limits. Use exclusive mode when the experiment needs the whole device, has unpredictable memory behavior, or must avoid interference.

## Create Safely

- Generate one stable operation ID for each create or edit intent and reuse it only for exact retries.
- Never reuse an operation ID for changed fields, command arguments, working directory, or
  submission `PATH`; GPUBK verifies the private command digest and rejects mismatched reuse.
- Never pass, invent, or override a UID. GPUBK derives identity from the local process.
- Do not retry a write with a new operation ID after an ambiguous response; inspect reservations first.
- After an interrupted scheduled-command submission, retry with the same operation ID and exact
  command. GPUBK retains a committed referenced spec and prunes only a verified unreferenced one.
- When an exact retry returns `allocator.source=idempotent-replay`, treat it as committed-write
  confirmation. GPUBK skipped new live probes, external allocation, and private-spec creation;
  `unknown` live fields are intentional and do not prove that the command can launch now.
- Do not cancel or edit another user's reservation.
- GPUBK snapshots only `PATH` for a scheduled command, not the rest of the Agent environment.
  Put required variables and credentials in a user-owned wrapper or configuration file; do not
  expose secrets in command arguments.

To schedule a command:

```bash
bk 2 1h30m --mem 12g --op-id <stable-id> -- python train.py --config exp.yaml
```

GPUBK sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`; do not add physical GPU IDs to the training command.
For unattended work, require `capabilities.stable_device_identifier=true` on every recommended
GPU. The default live guard uses those stable identifiers and leaves the job pending if a real
NVML device cannot be bound safely.

## Handle Results

- `created`: reservation starts at the returned time.
- `updated`: the approved edit was applied.
- `queued`: reservation was moved to the earliest legal future slot because start was implicit.
- `exists`: the operation ID was already applied; treat this as idempotent success. Check worker
  state separately before promising that a scheduled command remains launchable.
- JSON exit `2`: invalid request or write conflict. Inspect `error.message`.
- Recommendation exit `3`: no legal exact slot; present `nearest_available` without booking it.
- Daemon exit `78`: trusted configuration does not match the ledger. Stop retrying and surface an
  operator repair action; never change policy limits to bypass it.
- Context VRAM values distinguish known zero from unknown: `memory.used_mb=0` means the GPU is
  known empty, while `null` means telemetry is unavailable. Never coerce one into the other.
- `uncertain` job: it may have run or produced partial side effects. Inspect `recovery_state`,
  processes, and private logs before using duplicate-risk retry. A recovered `terminated` group is
  still uncertain; never present it as safe automatic retry.
- `pending` with `launch_guard_state=waiting`: the reservation is active, but a live process or VRAM check blocked launch. Report `message`; do not bypass the guard unless the user explicitly accepts that collision risk.
- Cancellation results include `private_job_cleanup`; cancellation remains committed when cleanup
  reports a warning. Surface that warning instead of retrying the destructive operation.
- `bk log --json` returns only the current UID's bounded recent audit tail. Surface a non-null
  warning because it may indicate a damaged tail or that the 64 MiB scan ceiling was reached.

For edits, reject started reservations and explicit starts in the past. A valid explicit `start`
is exact and does not move unless `allow_queue=true` was explicitly requested to resolve a
resource conflict. Keep `bk worker` running for scheduled commands. Use `list_gpu_reservations`,
`bk j --json`, or the bounded job-log tool to inspect state. `cleanup_my_job_specs` and
`cleanup_my_job_logs` expose separate idempotent private cleanup operations. `bk j --cleanup
--json` runs both. Never remove runnable/retryable specs or logs; report cleanup warnings and
quota excess to the user.
Only one worker may hold a UID's private job directory. Exit `75` means another worker already
holds the lease; do not loop or start a second worker.
Capability `daemon_policy_guard=true` means worker transactions and monitor sampling revalidate
the bound policy. Context `policy.daemon_policy_exit_code` supplies the persistent-error status.
`policy.worker_effective_max_parallel` is the default scheduled-command concurrency after the
configured safety cap is bounded by GPU shared capacity. Do not interpret it as extra capacity.
Budget around `policy.worker_termination_grace_seconds`: scheduled commands receive TERM before
`end_at` and cannot consume that warning window as guaranteed compute time.
Before promising unattended execution, check `context.worker.running` or run
`bk worker --status --json`. Only `state=running` with `running=true`, `lease_held=true`, and
`instance_match=true` proves that the kernel lease belongs to this data directory; PID, hostname,
and acquisition time are diagnostic metadata. `stopped`, `not-seen`, `other-instance`,
`unverified`, `invalid`, and `unavailable` do not prove that a scheduled command will launch.
Create and edit `booking_result` payloads include this same `worker` document when the reservation
has a command, and `null` otherwise. Surface any worker warning immediately; booking success is not
evidence of unattended command execution.

## Respect Safety Boundaries

- External AI allocator output is advisory ordering only. Local time, capacity, VRAM, identity,
  ledger-policy, and transaction checks remain authoritative and run before edit-time allocator
  invocation where applicable.
- Treat `exclude_gpus` as a per-request constraint and `disabled_gpus` as administrator policy.
  Do not alter either list merely to force an unavailable request through validation.
- Treat live utilization as a soft forecast because running processes have no reliable end time.
- Check `policy.monitoring.collector.fresh` before treating recent telemetry as current. A
  degraded, stale, stopped, topology-mismatched, missing, or invalid collector is never proof
  that a GPU is idle.
- For unattended commands, also require an empty
  `policy.monitoring.collector.stable_device_identifier_gap` and
  `policy.monitoring.collector.process_identity_gap`; a fresh degraded collector is not sufficient.
- Do not delete journal or lock files manually.
- Never apply `sudo bk admin init` without an explicit administrator request. Use its `--dry-run`
  form first. `access=all` exposes the broker socket to local accounts; it does not grant direct
  ledger write permission.
- Never apply `sudo bk admin transfer` without an explicit administrator request. Require a dry-run,
  a stopped broker and monitor, and preserve its recovery journal after any interrupted handoff;
  never rewrite reservation UIDs or copy the live ledger as a substitute.
- Do not enable a worker, monitor, or service on a shared server without the user's or administrator's approval.
- Never run `sudo bk admin cluster delete` without explicit administrator approval. It
  removes only client-side routing, but every user on that client immediately loses the
  federated view; it must not be presented as a way to delete remote reservations or data.
- Do not disable `worker_live_guard` merely to make a scheduled command start sooner.
- Before an approved service deployment, run `bk doctor --probe --json --strict` as a normal user
  to verify broker connectivity, then as the configured monitor UID to verify writes and process
  attribution. Do not treat a simulation or single-host NFS lock check as proof of the complete
  production boundary.
- After starting the monitor service, run `bk doctor --require-monitor --json --strict`; a
  preflight without a heartbeat does not prove the long-running collector is alive.
- After starting a per-user worker service, run `bk doctor --require-worker --json --strict`;
  only the current UID and exact data-directory instance may satisfy it.
